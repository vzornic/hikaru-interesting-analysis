    "## Data enrichment\n",
    "Now we have all Hikaru games for 2023 downloaded. Our next step is to enrich and reformat this data, so we can use it more easily in when doing our analysis. We will be focused on enriching each move data along with adding some data to entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PGN\n",
    "The data that comes from chess.com is in PGN format however this format does not look nice to me neither it is easy to parse in runtime and perform analysis. I want to add additional field to our data which is parsed moves field which will contain list of moves with some metadata attached to each move.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stockfish\n",
    "\n",
    "Stockfish is state-of-the-art chess engine which we will be using for extracting some information on the board position. Settings of stockfish we will be using are default stockfish settings.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Move\n",
    "\n",
    "Function below will extract and enhance our move objects with lots of data. Given that we will be using this data in our analysis lets talk about each of them\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Eval\n",
    "This is simply evaluation given by stockfish after current move has been made. As per stockfish documentation this will return either **centipawns** (positive for white advantage, negative for black advantage) or **mate** if there is mate in N moves.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "This will be true if current move is one of the best two moves offered by stockfish.\n",

    "Number of pieces left (all pieces including pawns) after move has been made.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ~~WDL~~ (Deprecated in favor of eval)\n",
    "This is WDL statistics offered by stockfish after move has been made. Basically this is array of 3 integers on scale 0 - 1000 each representing W/D/L score. Given that stockfish returns this for the player who needs to make move I have reverted W and L to get stats for the player who made the move.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "##### Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Will represent a phase of a game which may be OPENING, MIDDLEGAME and ENDGAME. As OPENING phase I consider first 10 moves and as ENDGAME I consider situation where there is less than 15 pieces on the board, everything else is MIDDLEGAME.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### ~~WDL Flags~~ (Deprecated in favor of eval flags)\n",
    "This map contains flags that I've extracted out of WDL which may be interesting for our analysis. For this I'm comparing previous WDL of same player with current WDL of player. These flags are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bad_move** If Loosing chances after this move increased more than threshold (100).\n",
    "- **keep_advantage_move** If player has positive W score, and it is increased comparing to the last one.\n",
    "- **take_advantage_move** If player after this move has W score increased by threshold (100).\n",
    "- **recover_move** If players L score decreases comparing to last one and draw difference is greater than threshold (70).\n",
    "- **decrease_advantage** If player still has W score positive however it decreased comparing to last one.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Eval Flags\n",
    "Here we have extracted many flags related to chess.com move classification which ranges from Best - Blunder. Besides classifying move we also extracted a flag on whether this was what we call \"only move\". Now only moves are not same as in chess.com classification as here they simply mean that opponent did make a bad move and our move did take advantage on that.\n",
    "I have also extracted the information on whether the only move was to take advantage or make more draw chances on lost position and if only move was missed.\n"
